        Hello! My name is Farhan Mahbub. I am a Computer Science student
        attending the University of Central Florida.

      <p>
        I am interesting in pursuing a career in software engineering. More
        specifically, I want to get into full-stack web development and machine
        learning. I am currently learning React and Tailwind CSS which is what I
        used to create this website.
